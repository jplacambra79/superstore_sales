The objective of this project was the creation of a powerbi dashboard, to allow the consolidation and analysis of different sales and profit indicators. This dashboard is composed by three pages, aimed at several audiences, ranging from the sales teams to managers.

Originally, we were given a csv file with the dataset. This file was divided into 4 datasets (sales, shipment, location, customer), generating a new csv file for each one of them.

The newly generated datasets, comprised of the customer variables (customer Name, Segment), shipment variables (Ship Mode), location variables (City, Postal Code, Region, State) and the Ids for each one of them (Customer ID, location_id, Shipment_ID). On the other hand, the sales dataset comprises the original variables as well as the mentioned ids from customer, shipment and location tables. In this way, we were able to generate a star like E-R diagram.
